## My process

- I downloaded the starter file from FrontEndMentor and began analyzing the design file / redline. After thinking about how I would tackle the project I began to build out the HTML structure before proceeding to the CSS styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- Again I had the opportunity to work with flexbox and familiarize myself with it further. I also enjoyed using the :hover states on the css. I also got a chance to work with an SVG file which I previously had no experience with. Learned that it is not identical to a img.
